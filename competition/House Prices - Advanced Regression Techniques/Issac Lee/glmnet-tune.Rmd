Let's tune our Lasso panalty that we have built in the last [article](https://www.kaggle.com/issactoast/lasso-with-tidymodels).

# Preparations (준비작업) {.tabset .tabset-fade}

## Libraries

We mainly exploits the functions from the tidyvers and tidymodels packages. `magrittr` has my favorite operators!

```{r load_lib, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(tidymodels)
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(skimr)
library(knitr)
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

## Data load

```{r}
file_path <- "../input/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/"
files <- list.files(file_path)
files
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
train <- read_csv(file.path(file_path, "train.csv"))
test <- read_csv(file.path(file_path, "test.csv"))
```


# Data overview (데이터 기본정보) {.tabset .tabset-fade}

## Basic info.

Here is the basic information about `train` and `test`. We have approximately the same sample size for the train and test set. The number of columns in the train is 81 and the one in the test is 80.

```{r}
dim(train)
dim(test)
```

We can see train doesn't have the target variable `SalePrice`.

```{r}
"SalePrice" %in% names(test)
```


## Detailed info. `train`

```{r}
skim(train)
```

## Detailed info. `test`

```{r}
skim(test)
```

# EDA with visualization (탐색적 데이터 분석) {.tabset .tabset-fade}

## Distribution of `sale_price`

If we check out the distribution of the house price, it is little bit skewed to the right.

```{r message=FALSE, class.source = 'fold-hide'}
train %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = SalePrice)) +
  geom_histogram()
```
Since we want to build a linear regression assume that the noise follows the normal distribution, let us take a log to `SalePrice` variable.

```{r message=FALSE, class.source = 'fold-hide'}
train %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log(SalePrice))) +
  geom_histogram()
```

## `NA`s

There is a nice package for checking out `NA`s. Let's see how many variables we have which contains `NA`s.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, class.source = 'fold-hide'}
library(naniar)
train %>% 
  # select_if(~sum(is.na(.)) > 0) %>% # alternative way
  select(where(~sum(is.na(.)) > 0)) %>% 
  gg_miss_var()
```

We can do more analysis about `NA`s with `upset()` function, which shows that most of the observations with `NA`s in the data set have `NA`s at the `PoolQC`, `MiscFeature`, `Alley`, `Fence` at the same time.

```{r message=FALSE, class.source = 'fold-hide'}
train %>% 
  select(where(~sum(is.na(.)) > 0)) %>% 
  gg_miss_upset()
```

From the above, we can have some insights that if a house doesn't have Pool, it is likely that it doesn't have Alley, Fence, and Fireplace too.

# Preprecessing with `recipe` (전처리 레시피 만들기)

First, I would like to clean the variable names with `janitor` package so that we have consistent varible names.

## `all_data` combine and name cleaning with `janitor`

```{r}
all_data <- bind_rows(train, test) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
names(all_data)[1:10]
```

## Make recipe

Note that we will use mode imputation for nominal variables for the baseline, and the mean imputation for the numerical variables. However, this should be changed to build a more sensitive model because we have checked that the `NA` in the nominal variables indicates that cases where the house doesn't have the corresponding attributes.

```{r}
housing_recipe <- all_data %>% 
  recipe(sale_price ~ .) %>%
  step_rm(id) %>% 
  step_log(sale_price) %>% 
  step_modeimpute(all_nominal()) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal()) %>% 
  step_meanimpute(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_normalize(all_predictors()) %>% 
  prep(training = all_data)

print(housing_recipe)
```

## `juice` the all_data2 and split

```{r}
all_data2 <- juice(housing_recipe)
```

We are done for preprocessing. Let's split the data set.

```{r}
train_index <- seq_len(nrow(train))
train2 <- all_data2[train_index,]
test2 <- all_data2[-train_index,]
```


```{r}
train2 %>% 
  head() %>% 
  kable()
```

# Split the train into two

We will devide `train2` into two sets: model training part and assessment part. To evaluate the models with a specific panalty parameter, we need to split the `train2` again; we cannot use test set, right? :)

```{r}
set.seed(2021)

validation_split <- validation_split(train2, prop = 0.7)

# actual split id stored in the following
# validation_split$splits[[1]]$in_id
# the whole point is that it's there and trust tidymodels :)
head(validation_split$splits[[1]]$in_id)
```

The key part is that, we will choose the panalty that performs well on the `validation_set`.

# Set the tuning spec

```{r}
tune_spec <- linear_reg(penalty = tune(), mixture = 0) %>%
  set_engine("glmnet")

lambda_grid <- grid_regular(penalty(), levels = 50)
```

# Set workflow()

```{r}
workflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(tune_spec) %>% 
  add_formula(sale_price ~ .)
```


# Tuning the lambda

```{r}
doParallel::registerDoParallel()

tune_result <- workflow %>% 
  tune_grid(validation_split,
            grid = lambda_grid,
            metrics = metric_set(rmse))
```

```{r}
tune_result %>% 
  collect_metrics()
```

# Visualization of the tunning result

```{r message=FALSE}
tune_result %>%
  collect_metrics() %>%
  ggplot(aes(penalty, mean, color = .metric)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "RMSE")
```

```{r}
tune_result %>% show_best()
```

```{r}
tune_best <- tune_result %>% select_best(metric = "rmse")
tune_best$penalty
```


# Set Ridge regression model and fitting (Ridge regeression 모델 설정 및 학습)

Set `mixture` is equal to zero refering the Ridge regression in `glmnet` since the 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
lasso_model <- 
    linear_reg(penalty = tune_best$penalty, # tuned penalty
               mixture = 0) %>% # lasso: 1, ridge: 0
    set_engine("glmnet")

lasso_fit <- 
    lasso_model %>% 
    fit(sale_price ~ ., data = train2)

options(max.print = 10)
lasso_fit %>% 
    tidy() %>% 
    filter(estimate > 0.001)
```

# Prediction and submit (예측 및 평가)

```{r warning=FALSE}
result <- predict(lasso_fit, test2)
result %>% head()
```

```{r}
submission <- read_csv(file.path(file_path, "sample_submission.csv"))
submission$SalePrice <- exp(result$.pred)
write.csv(submission, row.names = FALSE,
          "lasso_regression_tuned.csv")
```
